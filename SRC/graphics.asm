; SNES DMA register adresses
; $420B - main DMA register. It is used to enable DMA channel transfer.
; $43x0 - specifies how channel is supposed to perform transfer using bitmask
;         (where x is DMA channel index. From 0 to 7. 0 has the highest priority)
; $43x1 - DMA channel x destination address ($21XX) where XX - address stored in $43x1 register
; $43x2 - DMA channel x source address offset (low-bytes)
; $43x3 - DMA channel x source address offset (high-bytes)
; $43x4 - DMA channel x source address bank
; $43x5 - DMA channel x transfer size (low-bytes)
; $43x6 - DMA channel x transfer size (high-bytes)
